1. Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new web application designed to streamline mentor workflows within the existing wethinkcode platform. The goal is to improve efficiency and provide better data for tracking student progress.

2. Technical Stack

Backend: Java Springboot
Frontend: React
3. Target Users

Primary: wethinkcode Mentors
4. User Stories

As a mentor, I want to see a live dashboard of all upcoming activities for my mentees (assignments, code-pairing sessions, presentations, meetings, etc.) with clear due dates and times so I can plan my schedule effectively.
As a mentor, I want to access a dedicated section for each mentee where I can update and record progress comments, including strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
As a mentor, I want the ability to automate tasks such as progress updates and notifications to save time and reduce administrative burden.
As a mentor, I want real-time data on each mentee's progress to ensure accuracy and facilitate informed decision-making about their learning journey.
As a mentor, I want a quick and easy way to view the overall status of all my mentees to prioritize support and guidance.
As a mentor, I want a centralized platform for managing re-submissions, feedback sharing, and discussions with my mentees to improve communication and collaboration.
5. Features

5.1 Live Dashboard

Display upcoming assignments, code-pairing sessions, presentations, stand-up meetings, retrospectives, and theory sessions for all mentees assigned to the mentor.
Include clear due dates and times for each activity.
Allow filtering and sorting options to personalize the view (e.g., by due date, mentee name, program).
5.2 Mentee Progress Tracking

Provide a dedicated profile page for each mentee.
Allow mentors to update progress comments with specific details on strengths, weaknesses, areas for improvement, and notes from discussions.
Integrate with existing assessment data (if available) to provide a holistic view of mentee progress. Specify data format (e.g., API, CSV) and if it's a one-way or two-way sync.
5.3 Efficiency Boost

Automate sending notifications and reminders for upcoming deadlines and activities.
Enable bulk actions for common tasks (e.g., marking multiple assignments as complete).
Integrate with existing calendaring tools (specify supported tools) for seamless scheduling.
5.4 Improved Data Accuracy

Implement real-time updates for progress comments and mentor feedback.
Reduce manual data entry through automated features.
Include data validation to minimize errors.
5.5 Enhanced Visibility

Provide mentors with a clear overview of each mentee's overall progress status (e.g., on track, at risk).
Allow filtering and searching for mentees based on specific criteria (e.g., program, skill).
Offer customizable dashboards to prioritize mentees needing extra support.
5.6 Streamlined Communication

Integrate a messaging system for direct communication between mentors and mentees within the platform.
Facilitate easy re-submission of assignments and provide a platform for feedback exchange.
Enable threaded discussions for ongoing communication on specific topics.
6. Additional Considerations

Security: Implement user access controls and data encryption to ensure privacy and confidentiality of mentor and student information.
Reporting: Allow mentors to generate reports on mentee progress (individually or for groups) for data analysis and informed decision making. Define report formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).
Mobile Compatibility: Consider responsive design or a dedicated mobile app for easy access on the go.
User Interface (UI): Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface that is easy for mentors to navigate and understand. Specify desired look and feel (e.g., Material Design) or any existing wethinkcode UI components to integrate with.
7. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Performance: Define acceptable page load times and response times for user interactions.
Scalability: Specify how the system should handle an increase in the number of mentors and mentees.
Availability: Define the uptime requirements for the application (e.g., 99.5%).
8. System Integrations

Detail any integrations planned with external systems (e.g., calendaring tools, learning management systems). Specify data points to be exchanged and how the integration will be achieved (e.g., APIs).
9. Future Enhancements

Integrate with external learning management systems for a unified view of student progress.
Implement gamification elements to motivate
